In my Photomontages, I wanted to explore the ever-growing slew of trans hate here in the United States. I took images that I have taken myself as well as an image from Wikipedia Commons to demonstrate that our blood is on the hands of those who hate us and want us to be eradicated from public life. In the first photomontage, there is an image of myself with a bloody nose. The other images are an American flag and a wall of bloody handprints. I used the lighten and pin light blend modes.

In the second Photomontage, I wanted to follow a similar theme. It is a picture of a dead deer found on my lawn a couple of years ago. Stitched within the image is an image of lights and an image of myself. I wanted this to demonstrate that there is a metaphorical connection between us and the dead deer. For to them, we are merely a spectacle. Something to be gawked at. For this photomontage, I used linear dodge and also the difference blend modes.
