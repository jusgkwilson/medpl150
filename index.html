    <h1>Justicia Wilson's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>My name is Justicia Wilson (she/her) and I am  visual and musical artist based in Brooklyn, NY. Originally from the suburbs of Pennsylvania, I moved to New York City in 2021 to pursue arts and media studies originally at the New School but eventually left school to discover and explore different opportunities in the arts. Beginning my artistic journey in my teens, I was drawn to photography because of its ability to capture moments in time. Photography has always been an outlet of expression for me and a means of cementing my perspective of the world as a trans woman of color.  

As of late I am mostly interested in the relationships between fashion, trans femininity, and storytelling shown up against a history informed Americana backdrop. I also create paintings that touch on themes of self-discovery, sex, societal roles, and memory. For me, memory is something that guides me through my art-making practices. Admittedly, my memory is not incredible, but the memories and feelings associated with them manifest themselves in the art that I create and the art I create that I resonate the most with. Personal history informs the art that I create, and I tend to use art as a means of expressing and releasing those memories and events that have occurred in my life. Memory and history tie in with each other and intersect in so many ways.  As I am learning more history throughout my studies, I would like to input what I learn into the art that I create.  </p>
