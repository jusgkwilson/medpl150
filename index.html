    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>My name is Justicia Wilson (she/her) and I am  visual and musical artist based in Brooklyn, NY. Originally from the suburbs of Pennsylvania, I moved to New York City in 2021 to pursue arts and media studies originally at the New School but eventually left school to discover and explore different opportunities in the arts. Beginning my artistic journey in my teens, I was drawn to photography because of its ability to capture moments in time. Photography has always been an outlet of expression for me and a means of cementing my perspective of the world as a trans woman of color.  

As of late I am mostly interested in the relationships between fashion, trans femininity, and storytelling shown up against a history informed Americana backdrop. I also create paintings that touch on themes of self-discovery, sex, societal roles, and memory. For me, memory is something that guides me through my art-making practices. Admittedly, my memory is not incredible, but the memories and feelings associated with them manifest themselves in the art that I create and the art I create that I resonate the most with. Personal history informs the art that I create, and I tend to use art as a means of expressing and releasing those memories and events that have occurred in my life. Memory and history tie in with each other and intersect in so many ways.  As I am learning more history throughout my studies, I would like to input what I learn into the art that I create.  </p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Creating this website and beginning the process of this assignment was definitely a challenge for me. I can definitely say that I was intimidated when I first read the assignment because I have no experience with this type of stuff except for when I accidentally press Inspect Element.  I am surrounded by people who are interested in this technology, but I never took the chance to explore it. While I have been interested in learning more about coding and how websites are made, I do not always have the energy or patience to sit down and figure something technological out. I am learning that with time and patience that I can learn something that was intimidating or at least begin learning. I still have so much to learn when it comes to making this site, but I will say that I not entirely excited before about starting it from the ground up but as I have gotten more experience and also experienced success using and operating Github, I am more eager to learn.  

I am excited to look back at the end result of my site at the end of the semester and see the progress of the assignments and creations I will have made. I think that it is going to be very rewarding to see how my skills at using this once extremely intimidating technology will have progressed and improved over time. I am eager to learn more and add more throughout the semester. I cannot wait to see how my learning progresses.</p>
