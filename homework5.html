In this updated photomontage, I wanted to extend upon the already existing themes of blood through rectangles that frame the original photomontage. I then used various effects including grain, oil paint, and blending to create this image. I chose the color red to match with the blood of my bloody nose as well as the stripes from the American flag featured in the original photomontage. I found this homework assignment to be very fun to experiment with. Using Illustrator at first to create the shapes and color, I then transported it into Photoshop to then experiment more with the effects. I find that homework assignments like these are good exercises for me to become more comfortable, as well as creative, using these applications. Exercises like these are a good way of extending and creating themes throughout bodies of work, and I become excited and curious about finding ways to tie in different creative projects together. Moving forward, I definitely want to experiment with Photoshop and Illustrator more, whether it be for class, professional use, or personal projects. I can now say I am familiar with both applications, which I was not able to say before I registered and joined this wonderful class. When I began this class, I was unfamiliar with both Photoshop as well as Illustrator, but through the course of the semester I have grown more comfortable as well as curious while using them and cannot wait to utilize them moving forward with my future creative endeavors.
