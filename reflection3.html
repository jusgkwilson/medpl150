<p>When taking the pictures I struggled with the exposure as well as maintaining the same composition in each photograph. I found it to be difficult because of the level of light that I was shooting in (it was in my dimly lit living room) and I specifically had trouble choosing the right and appropriate ISO. However, once I was able to get two different photographs with the different depth of fields, I was then able to get two photographs with similar enough exposures. I have had years of experience taking photographs, but this was definitely something that challenged me to brush up on my photography skills that I have not used in quite a bit of time.  It forced me to adjust the different settings to get the right and similar exposure.  

I always enjoy fiddling and adjusting the different settings that the Camera Raw Filter gives us access to. I think it is quite fun and a good exercise in finding your own style when editing your photographs. Having the two photographs being essentially the same photograph also was interesting because I got to compare how I adjusted and edited both of the photographs.  

I am extremely excited to see how to use these different techniques we used in this assignment and translate them into the photomontage assignment. I am also excited to see how my classmates will tackle the assignment and their progress in Photoshop. I am also looking forward to exploring more in Photoshop and strengthening my own skills.  </p>
