    The original photograph is of my dear friend, Lunetta, in a vintage Betsey Johnson gold dress. It was taken in the summer of 2024. I wanted to choose colors that were warm because it was taken during the summer. I used the pen tool to outline the foreground, middle ground, and background and then used different distortion effects as well as the film grain effect to stylize the images and blocks of color.
