  <h1>Photography is such an incredibly powerful tool that has shaped the perspectives of so many individuals throughout the span of time. Photography allows us to connect with not only the moment that the photograph is being taken, but also the past and also the future. When I think of the images that have shaped my perspective and worldview, I realize that these images have all existed at one moment in time. One image that continues to haunt me to this day, even after all of the years since I have seen it for the first time, is the photograph titled “The Terror of War”. The photograph documents a 9-year-old girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, running towards the camera after being burned by a napalm strike. I remember seeing this image as a young child, immediately stricken by the severity and horror captured through the medium of photography. The moment that I first saw this photograph was one of the moments in my entire life that I realized the importance and guttural power of photography. 

To answer the question surrounding how photography can shape how we see the world, I reflect on the power of capturing a moment. To photograph is document. To photograph is to capture. To photograph is to memorialize. To photograph is to choose a moment in the entire timeline of the universe and decide that it needs to document. Every second that passes is lost in the hands of time and photography allows us to savor and reflect on the moments that have passed on from us. I think nowadays people take photography for granted in some ways. Back when photography was first being introduced, it was such a spectacle for people to witness. Moments that otherwise would have been lost could now be immortalized for the future to see.  With the advent of newer technologies, we find ourselves trapped in an age of photography being seen as something to be taken advantage of or even taken for granted. Photography 	has always allowed us to investigate the past, but I personally do not think that people realize that.  

	I think that with the changing times, photography must change as well in some ways. I think that the invention of the Internet and the ways in which we consume photography have allowed us as people to become more desensitized to the importance and utility of the art of image making. We consume so much media in our daily lives, that it seems as if we cannot escape the overwhelming feeling of being thrown into the whirlwind of consumption. I think that to capture the moment of today and the present is to value the past, even if it is filled with pain and trauma, to learn we must look to the past to better understand the future that we indeed would like to see. I have always admired photography for its ability to give meaning to moments that we may even deem unimportant. Every moment that we have on this planet and in this timeline is important and informative. Photography allows us to cement those moments in our consciousness.  </h1>
