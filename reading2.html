As users of the Internet, we are bombarded with AI images and videos every time we log into the sites that provide us with the apt environments to doomscroll and distract ourselves from our realities. Within the past two years, the question has been on everyone’s minds: is this real or is this AI? Videos of cats, cakes, toilets made from glass, and many more images permeate our phone screens. More sinisterly, images harkening back to fascist nostalgia wiggle their way into our devices and our governments. I can’t help but wonder what the modern world would be like without the rampant use of AI.  

Even with less sinister uses of AI, there are still the consequences of it. The impact it has on the environment is something that can’t be ignored. We now live in a world where ChatGBT is used instead of our brains to complete assignments and ask even basic questions. It leads me to wonder what the outcome of this will be. Will we live in a world where AI is the default? What does it mean to be intellectually distinct from the hands of AI?  

Big social media companies love AI. They are pleased with the fact that it drives any engagement on their platforms, even if it has negative consequences. But what does it mean for the average person? Does it mean that we slowly lose faith in what we’re seeing? Every time we decide to use a social media platform, are we wavering over the right to see images and creations that came directly from a human being?  

I think in the time of AI and its ever-growing popularity, it is up to the artists of our generation to create more from our own minds and experiences. Reading this article inspires me to create more. For there is only one me and only one person that can create the art that I can make myself. With the rise of AI, how do we cut through all the trash to find treasures? I think it can be quite simple at times. To keep doing what we were doing before AI became a household idea that everyone is familiar with. We just have to keep creating. AI cannot replicate the emotions, meaning, and impact that humans can with their minds. While I understand that AI is very powerful and can be useful in some situations, specifically the use of AI to create art will never, for me at least, measure up to the talent and creativity of human beings.  

This article has inspired me to want to create more and do more of what I’ve been doing for my entire life. To create is to be powerful and to be able to create is a privilege that not everyone can access. It is ultimately up to us whether we will succumb to the AI slop that saturates our screens on a daily basis. I believe that we will continue to create even with the use of AI technology being more prevalent in our societies.
