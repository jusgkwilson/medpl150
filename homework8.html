    In my first animated gif, I wanted to test myself and my abilities in Photoshop and create not only a pair of eyes as they blink but also a widening grin to accompany the eyes. It was really interesting and exciting to make a gif and I am glad to be able to make them now.  I chose the colors blue and brown because I felt they were close enough to the complimentary colors of orange and blue. I designed the eyes in illustrator and then imported them into Photoshop and created the gif there. For the Puppet Warp gif, I decided to use a picture of myself during Halloween. I was dressed as a vampire and wanted to emphasize a sense of distortion within my own perception of my appearance. The photo was taken using my bathroom mirror and it is my own point of view. The way I achieved the mirroring effect in Photoshop was creating each layer with its own use of the puppet warp effect, and then I copied the image and then pasted it into each individual layer. Now that I know more about Photoshop, I am interested in experimenting with it within my own personal projects. I am also interested in making videos into gifs and sharing them with people. I am wondering now what the process of converting a video into gif form would look like using Photoshop, if that is the preferred way of converting said video. This ultimately was a very interesting and fulfilling experience.
